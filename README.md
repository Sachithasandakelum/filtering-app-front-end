# Filtering App - Front End

## Introduction

Welcome to the front-end of the Filtering App! This front-end application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the back-end API of the Filtering App. Users can utilize various filtering options to retrieve and display customer information. The front-end is built using modern web development technologies, including Bootstrap for styling, Parcel for bundling and serving the application, and Abortable Fetch for handling asynchronous requests.


## Technologies Used

- **Bootstrap:** The application utilizes Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, for creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

- **Parcel:** Parcel is employed as the application bundler, making it easy to bundle and serve static files. It simplifies the development workflow and optimizes the performance of the front-end.

- **Abortable Fetch:** Abortable Fetch is used for handling asynchronous requests. It provides the capability to abort fetch requests, ensuring efficient handling of ongoing requests, especially during user interactions like search.


## User Interface

The front-end provides a simple and intuitive user interface, allowing users to enter search queries, sort columns, and paginate through the customer data. The UI is designed for a seamless user experience, making it easy to explore and interact with the customer information.
